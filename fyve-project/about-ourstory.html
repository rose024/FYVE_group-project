        <p> Welcome to FYVE Festival, a community-based festival in Vancouver, BC. We are passionate about raising
            awareness and funds to support those affected by the opioid crisis and the stigma surrounding addiction.
        </p>
        <p> Vancouver has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with devastating effects on individuals, families, and
            communities. We believe that everyone deserves support and compassion, regardless of their circumstances.
            FYVE Festival is our way of giving back to the community and making a positive impact on those who need
            it the most. Our festival aims to create a safe and inclusive space where people can come together, enjoy
            live music,
            art, and culture, and learn about the challenges and solutions related to addiction and recovery. We believe
            that education and awareness are key to reducing the harm caused by the opioid crisis, and we strive to
            provide
            opportunities for people to engage with this important issue.
        </p>
        <p>Through our festival, we hope to bring attention to the complex social, economic, and health issues related
            to
            addiction and homelessness. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to recover, and we are committed to
            working
            with our community partners to provide support and resources to those who need it the most.<br> We are
            driven by a
            sense of compassion and empathy for those who are struggling with addiction and homelessness. We believe
            that together,
            we can make a difference and create an equal society for all. No matter who you are, or where you’ve come
            from; you
            matter to us. Join us on our mission to support those in need and make a positive impact on our community.
        </p>

        <h1> OUR MISSION & VALUE</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p> Our mission at FYVE Festival is to raise awareness and funds to support those affected by the opioid
                crisis and
                homelessness in Vancouver, BC. We believe that everyone deserves access to resources and support to
                overcome addiction.
                Through our festival, we strive to create a safe and inclusive space for people to learn about addiction
                and recovery
                while promoting a culture of compassion and empathy. We the founders of FYVE Fest value advocating for
                the vulnerable,
                and being the voice of change. The importance of having a community and being there for one another is
                the beauty of
                human nature; the power of unity and love can heal any wound. We want to show the world that we as
                people can unite and
                support our community and the many other communities struggling with the burdening grasp of addiction.

        <h1> THE CRISIS</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Vancouver is known for its natural beauty and fast paced lifestyle. With record breaking housing prices
                and the
                outrageous cost of living the individuals living here are struggling beyond measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the streets in the lower mainland are riddled with poverty and addiction due mainly to the
                opioid crisis.
                The opioid crisis began when fentanyl; a horrific drug, was introduced into the streets; not only in
                Vancouver
                but worldwide. Fentanyl is a drug that is almost 50 times stronger than heroin; it has taken the lives
                of millions
                and has destroyed countless families and loved ones alike. Addiction can affect anyone. It doesn’t pick
                and
                choose between people. Simply put;<b> it can happen to you.</b>
